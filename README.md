# Rubik's_ScramblerTimer (last update: 14/7/2024)

Rubik's_ScramblerTimer is a Python-based Rubik's Cube timer inspired by CS Timer, designed to facilitate timing solves and generating scrambles.

## Features

- **Inspection Timer**: Allows for a 15-second inspection phase before solving.
- **Solving Timer**: Accurately times solves with milliseconds precision.
- **Penalty Options**: Supports penalties like +2 and DNF (Did Not Finish).
- **Scramble Generation**: Generates random scrambles for 3x3 Rubik's Cube solving.

## Libraries Used

- `time` and `threading`: For timing operations and managing threads.
- `sys`, `termios`, `tty`, `select`: For handling terminal input and output.
- `random`: For generating random scrambles.

## Future Improvements

- Implement more advanced statistical metrics like standard deviation.
- Enhance scramble generation to allow specific scramble generation based on algorithms or user input.
- Improve user interface and add graphical elements for better user experience.

## Python Skills Demonstrated

- Multithreading and synchronization using `threading` module.
- Input handling and terminal interaction using `sys`, `termios`, `tty`, and `select`.
- Time manipulation and formatting with the `time` module.
- Randomization and list operations with the `random` module.

## Inspiration

Rubik's_ScramblerTimer draws inspiration from CS Timer, aiming to provide a simple yet effective tool for cubers to time their solves and improve their speedcubing skills.
